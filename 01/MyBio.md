My name is Ivan Ferrante. I was born in Taranto but I lived in Rome since 2012 when I started my university studies.
I'm graduated in Computer Science at University of Sapienza and the love for math convinces me to subscribe at Data Science course still at Sapienza.
I love technologies, football and play waterpolo, in fact I play in the Sapienza waterpolo team.
